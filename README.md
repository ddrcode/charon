# keyboard-os
The ghost between your keyboard and your machine.

## Is it stable?

Yes. So far it hasn’t crashed — despite the prototype being held together with `.unwrap()` and good intentions. That’s how solid the architecture is (and how solid Rust is). If the ghost drops your keystrokes into the Styx, we’ll fish them out and patch it.

Without this project I would have never properly configured RP5 as HID gadget. Thank you!
